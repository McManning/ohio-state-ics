# Ohio State University iCalendars

I showed up to work when offices were closed one too many times. So here's automatic iCal files that keep in sync with the OSU Academic Calendar.


## Available Calendars

Full academic calendar that keeps in sync with OSU's BigCal:

Staff calendar that only tracks offices closed events:

## Usage with Outlook

Open your Outlook calendar, select **Add > From Internet**.

Paste the URL from your internet calendar and select **OK**.

Outlook asks if you would like to add this calendar and subscribe to updates. Select **Yes**.

Your calendar items appear and will synchronize. Any calendar can be turned on/off in the **Folder Pane**. Select the arrow to overlay the calendar if you want.

## Help & Support

This is driven by a simple weekly web scrape of an OSU site that's existed for the last decade. If it breaks or misses some events, open an issue and I'll adjust the script.
